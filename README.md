# StateMatchingGame

This project was my final project for my Data Structures class. The purpose of the project was to gain experience 
using dictionaries, specifially the SortedDictionary class. It also gave me some experience working with LINQ. 
This project is a windows form application that displays the name and image of a state, and you must select the 
capital from a list. The program keeps track of how many you have correct and gives you a score when you are finished.
